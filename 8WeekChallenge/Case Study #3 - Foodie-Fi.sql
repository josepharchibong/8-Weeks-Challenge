-- Case Study Questions
-- This case study is split into an initial data understanding question before diving straight into 
-- data analysis questions before finishing with 1 single extension challenge.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------    SECTION A. Customer Journey    ---------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
-- write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
	--1. customer_id - 1 started with the free trial plan on 2020-08-01 and then a week later 
	--   after the free trial expired, they subscribed to the "basic monthly" plan.
	--2. customer_id - 2 started with the free trial plan on 2020-09-20 but seemed to enjoy the 
	--   service and subscribed to the "pro annual" plan after the free trial expired.
	--3. customer_id - 11 started with the free trial plan on 2020-11-19 but probably didnt like the 
	--   services and canceled the service after the free trial expired.
	--4. customer_id - 13 started with the free trial plan on 2020-12-15, subscribed for the 
	--   "basic monthly" plan a week later and after about 3 months, they upgraded to the 
	--   "pro monthly" subcription.
	--5. customer_id - 15 started with the free trial plan on 2020-03-17, subscribed to the 
	--   "pro monthly" plan a week later and then cancelled the service about a month later
	--6. customer_id - 16 started with the free trial plan on 2020-05-31, subscribed for the 
	--   "basic monthly" plan a week later and after about 4 and half months, they upgraded 
	--	 to the "pro annual" subcription.
	--7. customer_id - 18 started with the free trial plan on 2020-07-06 and went to subscribe for the 
	--   "pro monthly" plan a week later
	--8. customer_id - 19 started with the free trial plan on 2020-06-22, subscribed for the "pro monthly" 
	--   plan a week later and after 2 months, they upgraded to the "pro annual" subcription.

--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-----------------    SECTION B. Data Analysis Questions    --------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_customers
FROM 
(
	SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
	FROM dbo.subscriptions
) as distinct_customer
;


--2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - 
--   use the start of the month as the group by value
SELECT month_no, month, COUNT(month) as monthly_dist
FROM
(
	SELECT plan_id, start_date, DATEPART(month, start_date) as month_no, DATENAME(month, start_date) as 'month'
	FROM dbo.subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0
) as date_part
GROUP BY month_no, month
ORDER BY month_no
;


--3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the 
--   breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
SELECT start_year.plan_id, pla.plan_name, COUNT(start_year.plan_id) sub_count
FROM
(
	SELECT *, DATEPART(year, start_date) as year
	FROM dbo.subscriptions
) as start_year
	JOIN dbo.plans as pla
		ON start_year.plan_id = pla.plan_id
WHERE year > 2020
GROUP BY start_year.plan_id, pla.plan_name
ORDER BY 1
;


--4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
SELECT *, ROUND((CAST(churned_customers as float)/CAST(total_customers as float) * 100), 1) churned_percent
FROM
(
	SELECT	COUNT(
				CASE
					WHEN plan_id = 0
						THEN customer_id
				END) total_customers,
			COUNT(
				CASE
					WHEN plan_id = 4
					THEN customer_id
				END) churned_customers
	FROM dbo.subscriptions
) as customer_count
;


--5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
SELECT *, ROUND((CAST(churned_customers_2 as float)/CAST(total_customers as float) * 100), 0) as churned_percent
FROM
(
	SELECT	COUNT(
				CASE
					WHEN plan_id = 0
						THEN customer_id
				END) total_customers,
			COUNT(
				CASE
					WHEN plan_id = 4 AND cust_rank = 2
						THEN customer_id
				END) churned_customers_2
	FROM
	(
		SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS cust_rank
		FROM dbo.subscriptions
	) as customer_rank
) as customer_count_2
;


--6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
SELECT *, ROUND(CAST(subsequent_subscription as float)/CAST(total_subscriptions as float) * 100, 2) as subsequent_percent
FROM
(
	SELECT	COUNT(*) AS total_subscriptions,
			COUNT(	
				CASE
					WHEN cust_rank > 1
						THEN customer_id
				END) subsequent_subscription
	FROM
	(
		SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS cust_rank
		FROM dbo.subscriptions
	) as customer_rank
) as plans_subquery
;
